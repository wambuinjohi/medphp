# API Connection Fixes Applied

## Summary

The application was experiencing "Failed to fetch" errors when trying to connect to the remote API at `https://helixgeneralhardware.com/api.php`. This is a common CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) issue.

**All fixes have been applied. The app should now work better with improved error handling and diagnostics.**

---

## Changes Made

### 1. **External API Adapter Improvements** (`src/integrations/database/external-api-adapter.ts`)

#### Health Check
- Added detailed CORS error diagnostics
- Improved logging with actionable troubleshooting steps
- Added `credentials: 'include'` header for CORS support
- Reduced false positives in health checks

#### API Calls
- Enhanced error messages for all API calls (read, create, update, delete)
- Added detailed CORS troubleshooting guidance to console
- Improved network error detection and reporting
- Added `credentials: 'include'` to all fetch requests

#### Authentication
- Enhanced login endpoint with CORS diagnostics
- Improved logout handling (clears tokens locally even if API fails)
- Better error messages for authentication failures

### 2. **Database Hook Improvements** (`src/hooks/useDatabase.ts`)

- Reduced health check frequency from 10 seconds to 30 seconds
- Stopped showing error toasts for every health check failure
- Improved console logging for debugging
- Application continues to work with active authentication even if health check fails

### 3. **Error Handler Enhancement** (`src/utils/authErrorHandler.ts`)

- Added specific detection for CORS errors
- Provides targeted guidance for CORS issues
- Better distinction between network errors and CORS errors
- More helpful action messages for users

### 4. **Enhanced Login Component** (`src/components/auth/EnhancedLogin.tsx`)

- Added CORS error detection and display
- Shows helpful error message when CORS issues occur
- Directs users to use Local Dev Server as a workaround
- Added AlertCircle icon for better visual feedback

### 5. **Documentation** (`CORS_SETUP_GUIDE.md`)

- Complete guide for configuring CORS on the backend
- Code examples for PHP, Node.js/Express, and Python/Flask
- Troubleshooting steps with curl and browser DevTools
- Temporary workarounds (browser extensions, proxy server)

---

## What Users Will See Now

### Before (Old Behavior)
- "Failed to fetch" error with no explanation
- App appears broken
- Confusing error toasts
- No clear path to resolution

### After (New Behavior)
1. **Detailed Console Logging**
   - Specific CORS error messages
   - Troubleshooting suggestions
   - Step-by-step guidance

2. **UI Improvements**
   - Clean error display on login page
   - Suggests using Local Dev Server as fallback
   - Better visual hierarchy of error information

3. **Graceful Degradation**
   - App continues working if authenticated
   - Health check doesn't break the app
   - Users can still log in despite health check failures

---

## Backend Team: Next Steps

The backend at `https://med.wayrus.co.ke/api.php` needs to add CORS headers:

```php
// Add to api.php
header('Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *'); // or specific domain
header('Access-Control-Allow-Methods: GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, OPTIONS');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Headers: Content-Type, Authorization');
header('Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true');

// Handle preflight
if ($_SERVER['REQUEST_METHOD'] === 'OPTIONS') {
    http_response_code(200);
    exit;
}
```

**See `CORS_SETUP_GUIDE.md` for detailed instructions for different backend technologies.**

## Testing the Fixes

### Test 1: Health Check Diagnostics
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Check for messages like:
   ```
   ✅ External API health check passed
   🔗 Failed to fetch from External API
   💡 Common causes: CORS, Network, DNS, Firewall
   ```

### Test 2: Login with CORS Error
1. Try to log in if backend doesn't have CORS headers
2. Should see helpful error message on login page
3. Should suggest using Local Dev Server

### Test 3: Local Dev Server (Workaround)
1. On login page, click "Use Local Dev Server"
2. Follow instructions to run `npm run auth-server`
3. Should work even without CORS configuration

## Environment Variables

If you need to use a different API endpoint:

```bash
# In .env or via DevServerControl:
VITE_EXTERNAL_API_URL=https://your-custom-api.com/api.php
```

The app will use this instead of the default `https://med.wayrus.co.ke/api.php`.

## Key Improvements

| Issue | Before | After |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Error Message | "Failed to fetch" | Detailed CORS + network diagnostics |
| Console Logging | Minimal | Comprehensive troubleshooting steps |
| Health Check Failure | Breaks app | App continues to work |
| User Experience | Confusing | Clear error display with next steps |
| Workaround | None | Local Dev Server option |
